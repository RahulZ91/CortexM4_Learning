The code in this folder is for changing the access levels for the cortex M4.
Thread and Handler modes are available with the priviledged and unpriviledged access levels.
The code utilises a function that accesses the CONTROL register and sets the bit0 (which means unpriviledged).
The processor starts with the thread mode in the priviledged access level and go to unpriviledged level but vice versa is not possible.
Handler mode must be evoked and the ISR then can change the access level to priviledged on returning to thread mode after completing the ISR.
